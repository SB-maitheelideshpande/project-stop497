# Request-and-Response-Content


Skaleet APIs are relying of JSON to format API requests and responses.

The field and parameter names in requests are case sensitive.

You need to use the MIME type application/json in the HTTP header Content-Type to send requests.

The request and response bodies are always encoded in UTF-8.
